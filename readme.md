# Parcel Loading Updates

The parcels for MO West/East are updated yearly in Spire’s GIS. This requires identifying which counties have new parcel data for purchase, updating the existing Spire parcel FC with the new parcels, and updating the temporary parcels FC to delete unnecessary parcels due to the update.

## Getting Started

Updates to the updating workflow and process will be documented in the Jira under the Updated Parcel Loading issue. 

### Document Overview

* ParcelInventory.xlssx - A revised spreadsheet created to track parcel updates. 
* ParcelInventory_Codebook.doc - A word document containing relevant information on the spreadsheet headers.
